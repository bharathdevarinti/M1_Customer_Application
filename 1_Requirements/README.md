Customer Billing System Project is a simple console application designed to demonstrate the practical use of C programming language and its features as wells as to generate an application which can be used in any departmental store, shops etc. for billing to the customer.

The source code of Customer Billing System Project in C has been written in C programming language without of the use of any graphics. The code is complete, totally error free and not that long – just. It is to be compiled in Code::Blocks using GCC compiler.

I have added Add customer details, View existing customer details in the code etc.

# Requirements :-

It can hold many number of accounts and account can be added to the program at any time.

I added the establishment of clear payment terms upfront and provide complete and relevant information.

Payment processing − It involves posting of the customer's payments into his/her account.

Billing systems access sensitive data about your customers including credit scores, social security numbers and income.
